"While the dependency resolver at the heart of Poetry is highly optimized and"
" should be fast enough for most cases, sometimes, with some specific set of "
"dependencies, it can take time to find a valid solution."

msgid ""
"This is due to the fact that not all libraries on PyPI have properly "
"declared their metadata and, as such, they are not available via the PyPI "
"JSON API. At this point, Poetry has no choice but downloading the packages "
"and inspect them to get the necessary information. This is an expensive "
"operation, both in bandwidth and time, which is why it seems this is a long "
"process."

"A version constraint without an upper bound such as `*` or `>=3.4` will allow updates to any future version of the dependency.\n"

"Once a release of your package is published, you cannot tweak its "
"dependencies anymore in case a dependency breaks BC - you have to do a new "

"The only good alternative is to define an upper bound on your constraints, "
"which you can increase in a new release after testing that your package is "
"compatible with the new major version of your dependency."

"For example instead of using `>=3.4` you should use `~3.4` which allows all versions `<4.0`.\n"
