"What this means is that it will always work isolated from your global Python "
"installation.  To achieve this, it will first check if it's currently "
"running inside a virtual environment.  If it is, it will use it directly "
"without creating a new one. But if it's not, it will use one that it has "
"already created or create a brand new one for you."
